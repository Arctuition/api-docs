Welcome to the HappyScribe API  ðŸ‘‹

Using this API, you can programmatically submit files to be transcribed by HappyScribe. You can also access existing transcriptions and export them to various formats.

We try to be a RESTfull API, using appropriate resource names and verbs. Our API is versioned where breaking changes are released as incremental versions. We'll try our best not to release versions too often, and to reasonably support legacy versions.

If you have any questions, please write to us at [dev@happyscribe.co](mailto:dev@happyscribe.co). We'd love to hear from you!
