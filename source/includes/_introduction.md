Welcome to the Happy Scribe API  ðŸ‘‹

With this API you can automatically submit files to be transcribed by Happy Scribe, access existing transcriptions and export them to various formats.

This is a REST API that uses predictable resource names and verbs. Our API is versioned where breaking changes are released as incremental versions. We'll try our best not to release versions too often, and to reasonably support legacy versions.

If you have any questions, please write to us at [dev@happyscribe.com](mailto:dev@happyscribe.com). We'd love to hear from you!
