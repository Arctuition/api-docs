# Webhooks

Use incoming webhooks to get real-time updates.

ArcSite uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your organization. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events like new drawing created.

A webhook enables ArcSite to push real-time notifications to your app. ArcSite uses HTTPS to send these notifications to your app as a JSON payload. You can then use these notifications to execute actions in your backend systems.

You can create and manage your webhooks from [the ArcSite web UI](https://user.arcsiteapp.com#/admin).

A of webhook payload contains both _event type_ and _payload data_.

> Sample webhook payload

```json
{
  "event": "project.created",
  "data": {
    "id": 36029621652695040,
    "name": "project 4",
    "created_at": "2022-01-16T04:19:23",
    "updated_at": "2022-01-16T04:19:23",
    "job_number": "144111",
    "customer": {
      "name": "Jack",
      "phone": "1441",
      "second_phone": "1122"
    }
  }
}
```

## Built-in retries

ArcSite webhooks have built-in retry methods for 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx response status codes. If ArcSite doesn’t quickly receive a 2xx response status code for an event, webhooks will retry the event until it receives a 2xx response or up to certain times.

## Secure your endpoint

We highly recommend you secure your integration by ensuring your handler verifies that all webhook request are generated by ArcSite.

The following section describes how to verify webhook signatures:

- Retrieve your endpoint’s secret.
- Verify the signature.

**Retrieving your endpoint’s secret**

Use the [ArcSite Webhooks web UI](https://user.arcsiteapp.com/admin/webhooks) to get the webhook secret. ArcSite generates a unique secret key for each webhook.

> Sample webhook header

```json
{
  "ArcSite-Signature": "t=1716975491,v=5f43f28c3d33c34b18634399a8e3bb69dcfb9f146cea562289306d783187d0f1"
}
```

**Verifying the signature**

To verify the signature, you need to compare the signature in the header of the incoming webhook request with the signature using the secret and the request body.
The `ArcSite-Signature` header included in each signed event contains a timestamp and signature that you must verify. The timestamp is prefixed by `t=`, and the signature is prefixed by a `v=`.

> Python Example

```python
import hmac
import hashlib
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt


SECRET = 'your_webhook_secret'


def verify_webhook(header, payload, secret):
    # Extract timestamp and signature
    elements = dict(item.split('=') for item in header.split(','))
    timestamp, signature = elements['t'], elements['v']
    # Prepare signed payload string
    signed_payload = f"{timestamp}.{payload}"
    # Compute expected signature
    expected_signature = hmac.new(secret.encode(), signed_payload.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    # Verify signature
    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected_signature)


# Django Example
@csrf_exempt
def webhook_handler(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        header = request.headers.get('ArcSite-Signature')
        payload = request.body.decode('utf-8')
        if not verify_webhook(header, payload, SECRET):
            return HttpResponse('Invalid signature or timestamp.', status=400)
        # TODO Process the valid webhook payload here
        return HttpResponse('Webhook received successfully.', status=200)
    return HttpResponse('Method not allowed.', status=405)

```

**Step 1: Extract the timestamp and signature from the header**

Split the header using the `,` character as the separator to get a list of elements. Then split each element using the `=` character as the separator to get a prefix and value pair.
The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp and the prefix `v` to the signature. You can discard all other elements.

**Step 2: Prepare the `signed_payload` string**

The `signed_payload` string is created by concatenating:

- The timestamp (as a string)
- The character `.`
- The actual JSON payload (that is, the request body)

**Step 3: Determine the expected signature**

Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the webhook’s secret as the key, and use the `signed_payload` string as the message.

**Step 4: Compare the signature**

Compare the signature in the header to the expected signature.

> NodeJS Example

```js
const express = require("express");
const crypto = require("crypto");

const app = express();
const SECRET = "your_webhook_secret";

app.use(express.raw({ type: "*/*" }));

function verifyWebhook(header, payload, secret) {
  // Extract timestamp and signature
  const elements = header.split(",").reduce((acc, element) => {
    const [key, value] = element.split("=");
    acc[key] = value;
    return acc;
  }, {});
  const signature = elements["v"];
  // Prepare signed payload string
  const signedPayload = `${elements["t"]}.${payload}`;
  // Compute expected signature
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(signedPayload)
    .digest("hex");
  // Verify signature
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}

app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  const header = req.headers["arcsite-signature"];
  const payload = req.body.toString("utf-8");
  if (!verifyWebhook(header, payload, SECRET)) {
    return res.status(400).send("Invalid signature.");
  }
  // TODO Process the valid webhook payload here
  res.status(200).send("Webhook received successfully.");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port 3000`);
});
```
